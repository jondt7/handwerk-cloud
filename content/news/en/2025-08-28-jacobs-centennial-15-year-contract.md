The City of Centennial renewed Jacobs’ contract for another 15 years to manage a broad portfolio of municipal services: public works operations, traffic engineering, street rehabilitation, code enforcement, facilities management, and the city’s ~2,800 streetlights. According to the announcement, Jacobs will continue collaborating with PA Consulting to support intelligent transportation systems and digital infrastructure initiatives as the city scales its “future‑ready” strategy.

Why it matters: long‑duration revenue stability for Jacobs; a benchmark for KPI‑based outsourcing models; and a signal that workforce constraints and state‑of‑good‑repair backlogs are pushing cities to evaluate public–private operating arrangements.

For contractors and trades: expect programmatic paving/rehab (milling/overlay, ADA ramps, curb & gutter), ITS deployments (signal timing, adaptive systems, CCTV/V2X‑ready cabinets, fiber backbones), and facilities/code services (inspections, small works, energy retrofits).
