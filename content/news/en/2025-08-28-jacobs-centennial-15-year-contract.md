## Why it matters

- **Revenue stability:** Long‑duration O&M/management contracts provide predictable backlog for primes while smoothing municipal service delivery.
- **Outsourcing model:** Centennial is a benchmark for contracted‑out city services, where performance metrics and reaccreditations (e.g., APWA) underpin renewals and scope evolution.
- **Technology integration:** Scope targets ITS upgrades, LED/controls modernization, signal coordination, and groundwork for V2X‑ready corridors.

## What contractors and trades should watch

- **Programmatic paving & ADA:** multi‑year street rehab and ADA curb‑ramp compliance packages.
- **Signals & comms:** cabinet replacements, fiber backbones, adaptive timing, CCTV; integration with operations centers.
- **Facilities:** energy retrofits, asset‑condition work, and preventative maintenance across municipal buildings.
- **Streetlighting:** inventory normalization and controls/LED conversions; see the city’s [open‑data portal](https://open-centennial.opendata.arcgis.com/).

## Governance and risk

City councils typically tie renewals to SLAs/KPIs, cost transparency, and independent reviews. Given the contract’s length, risks include budget cycles, inflation in materials/labor, and technology obsolescence — managed via performance‑based provisions, scheduled rate adjustments, and alignment with capital planning.
