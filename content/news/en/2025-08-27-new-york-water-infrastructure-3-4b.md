## What was announced

New York’s Environmental Facilities Corporation (EFC) reports a record **US$3.4 billion** in state fiscal year 2025, financing **328** water‑infrastructure projects across all regions — a ~**55%** increase over the prior year. The figure is enabled by state funds plus federal support from the **Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (IIJA/BIL)**. EFC and the Governor’s office attribute **~30,000 jobs** to this year’s program.

## Program metrics and transparency

EFC’s **Program Metrics** summarize totals and link to a downloadable SFY 2025 metrics report. For market participants, the **Project Impact Dashboard** provides project‑level visibility (funding closed, construction status, funding type) and filters by program and geography.

## How the financing works

**State Revolving Funds (SRFs)** are the backbone: low‑cost loans and grants through the **Clean Water SRF (CWSRF)** and **Drinking Water SRF (DWSRF)**. The **Intended Use Plan (IUP)** prioritizes projects via a scoring and ranking process.

**Leverage effect:** EFC notes each federal dollar can leverage **>US$3** in total investment through state match, bond issuance, and reinvestment — amplifying capital available for municipal projects.

**Transparency & tracking:** The dashboard lists funded projects and completion status; EFC emphasizes public accountability since the dashboard’s 2024 rollout.

## Where contractors fit

The SFY 2025 portfolio spans:

- Treatment upgrades (PFAS/“emerging contaminants”, nutrient removal)
- Linear assets (lead service line replacement, CIPP and open‑cut pipe rehab, pump stations)
- Stormwater & resilience (green infrastructure, flood‑hardening, backup power/controls)
- Controls/SCADA modernizations and electrical gear replacements

Given U.S. supply‑chain constraints — especially long‑lead **switchgear/transformers** — owners and EPCs should front‑load procurement and lock long‑lead packages early in design. Contracting formats include **design‑bid‑build** and **design‑build**, often with **SRF grant overlays** (e.g., **WIIA/IMG**, Green Resiliency Grants).

## Economic and public‑health impact

The program tackles aging assets and regulatory mandates while distributing workload statewide, helping stabilize demand for civil contractors, electricians, and OEM suppliers. Public benefits include **drinking‑water quality**, **CSO mitigation**, and **storm resilience** as extreme‑weather events pressure legacy systems. The **~30k** job estimate underscores workforce needs across pipe crews, electricians, SCADA integrators, and heavy equipment operators.
