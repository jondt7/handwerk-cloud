FERC’s Energy Infrastructure Update (May 2025) shows the U.S. added more than 15 GW of utility‑scale generation in the first five months of 2025: ~11.5 GW solar, ~2.3 GW wind, and ~1.3 GW gas. Renewables (~91 %) dominate additions despite policy uncertainty. The current capacity mix remains gas‑heavy (~43 %), coal just under 15 %, solar/wind each a bit over 11 %, nuclear ~7.7 %.

FERC also catalogs “high‑probability” projects through 2028: ~133 GW total, of which ~90 GW solar and ~23 GW wind. Gas projects total around 20 GW over the same horizon, highlighting a dual trend: continued renewable growth with dispatchable gas retained for adequacy and flexibility. Transmission completions (e.g., 244 miles added, including 160 miles of 345 kV in Colorado) are reported separately.

Implications: solar balance‑of‑plant remains a volume driver; wind requires specialized heavy‑lift and concrete foundations; selective gas peakers/CCGTs provide reliability. Transmission bottlenecks persist; expect more work in line uprates and grid‑enhancing tech while corridor permitting advances.
