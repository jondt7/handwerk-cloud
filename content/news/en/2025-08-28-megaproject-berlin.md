Berlin launches a new urban quarter featuring 2,500 apartments, offices, and public infrastructure. The project emphasizes short build times through off-site prefabrication and timber-hybrid structures. Phase one prepares utilities and multiple plots in parallel.

Recycled materials are expected to play a significant role, while local contractors are involved early. The city expects first handovers from 2028.
